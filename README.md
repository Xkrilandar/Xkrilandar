## Hi there 👋

🔭 Master’s student at **EPFL**, currently conducting research at **Yale University** in the Laboratory for Intelligent Global Health Technologies under the guidance of Prof. Annie Hartley. The primary research project focuses on the Meditron initiative, which involves developing a LLM tailored for medicine, particularly in low resource settings.


## 🧠 Current Research

### 🌟 Meditron Project (Yale University & EPFL)
I am contributing to the development of Meditron, a large language model (LLM) designed for medicine, particularly for low-resource settings. Key areas include:
* Leading synthetic data initiatives for model training.
* Developing a multi-agent framework to improve model interactions.
* Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., Llama-70b) for medical applications.

## 🏆 Selected Publications
* **Meditron Paper**
  - (coming soon!)
* **GPoet: A Language Model Trained for Rhyme Generation on Synthetic Data**
  - _LaTeCH-CLfL 2023_ ([Read Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.latechclfl-1.2/))
  - Fine-tuned GPT-2 to improve rhyming in generated poetry, achieving 60% rhyming lines versus 11% prior to fine-tuning.
