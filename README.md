## Hi there 👋

🔭 Master’s student at **EPFL**, currently conducting research at **Yale University** in the Laboratory for Intelligent Global Health Technologies under the guidance of Prof. Annie Hartley. The primary research project focuses on the Meditron initiative, which involves developing a LLM tailored for medicine, particularly in low resource settings.


## 🧠 Current Research

### 🌟 Meditron Project (Yale University & EPFL)
I am contributing to the development of Meditron, a large language model (LLM) designed for medicine, particularly for low-resource settings. Key areas include:
* Leading synthetic data initiatives for model training.
* Developing a multi-agent framework to improve model interactions.
* Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., Llama-70b) for medical applications.
#### The weights for Meditron-3[70B] and Meditron-3[8B] are now available on Huggingface.:
- [OpenMeditron/Meditron3-8B](OpenMeditron/Meditron3-8B)
- [OpenMeditron/Meditron3-70B](OpenMeditron/Meditron3-70B)
